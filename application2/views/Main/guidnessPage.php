I was approached immediately by a female with long black hair who asked me what I would like to drink. Her badge indicated her name was Sally. Sally's customer service skills were excellent as she took my drinks order promptly, politely and with a smile, and the drinks were served perfectly. I had a Regular Coke and my guest had a diet cola. I noted that the Team Members' uniforms were all neat and tidy.</p>
